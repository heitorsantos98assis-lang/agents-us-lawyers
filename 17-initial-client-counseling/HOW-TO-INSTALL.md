# 17-initial-client-counseling — Claude Code Agent

A specialist subagent from the **57 Agents for US Lawyers** bundle (HL).

## What this agent does

See `17-initial-client-counseling.md` for the full description, frameworks, reference tables, and operating flow.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/claude-code) installed and logged in
- A terminal with `unzip`

### Install in 30 seconds

**1. Unzip this archive:**

```bash
unzip 17-initial-client-counseling.zip
```

**2. Copy the agent into your Claude Code project:**

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp 17-initial-client-counseling.md .claude/agents/

# OR install globally for all projects:
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp 17-initial-client-counseling.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

**3. Restart Claude Code** (or run `/agents` to refresh).

**4. Invoke the agent.** Just describe your task — Claude Code will pick this subagent automatically when relevant, or call it explicitly:
